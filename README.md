# AiBin

Implemented a classification model using transfer learning to classify waste into biodegradeable and non-biodegradable. Deployed this model on NVIDIA's Jetson Nano Developer Kit.
Also made servos functional on the Jetson Nano to automatically open appropriate bin on successful classification.

Made the Dataset from Scratch using Open CV library in Python.
